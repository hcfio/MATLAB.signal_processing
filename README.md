# MATLAB.signal_processing
Here are some examples of MATLAB programs for signal processing.
- signal.m a discrete time signal x(t) = sin(2t(t-3)(t-6)(t-9)(t-12))
- signal_fft.m the standard discrete Fourier transform
- signal_fft_shifted.m the shifted graph of the DFT
- signal_stft.m the spectrogram, i.e., the discrete short-time Fourier transform
- *.png results
